The computer programs or code used to convert the raw data into the final dataset used in the analysis plus a brief description that enables other researchers to use this program. The purpose of this requirement is to facilitate replication and to help other researchers understand in detail how the raw data were processed, the final sample was formed, variables were defined, outliers were treated, etc. This code or programming is in most circumstances not proprietary. However, we recognize that some parts of the code or data generation process may be proprietary, including from the authors’ perspective. Therefore, instead of the code or program, researchers can provide a detailed step-by-step description of the code or the relevant parts of the code such that it enables other researchers to arrive at the same final dataset used in the analysis. In such cases, the authors should inform the editors upon initial submission, so that the editors can consider an exemption from the code sharing requirement. Whenever feasible, authors should also provide the identifiers (e.g., CIK, CUSIP) for their final sample. Authors should consult our FAQ Sheet on the JAR website for further details.

The fraud firm years observations, SAS and Matlab programs used in this paper are publicly available on JAR online supplements and datasheet webpage (https://research.chicagobooth.edu/arc/journal-of-accounting-research/online-supplements).
The file "AAER_firm_year" contains both the initial fraud firm years from CFRM and additional fraud firm years of AAERs announced after September 30, 2016 up to December 31, 2018 by hand-collection.
The file “SAS coding” shows the process of merging fraud firm years with COMPUSTATA database and prepare necessary accounting features for our prediction models.
The file "run_RUSBoost.m" is the Matlab code to replicate the results of our fraud detection model RUSBoost. To run the code file, two additional Matlab files are required: (1) the file "data_reader.m" for reading the data, and (2) the file "evaluate.m" for evaluating model performance.
The file "tune_RUSBoost.m" is the Matlab code to replicate the hyper-parameter tuning for our RUSBoost model. The number of learners/trees is tuned by using the traditional grid search approach. Specifically, the parameter space is manually specified as [100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500, 3000]. For each hyper-parameter, the model is trained using the training period 1991-1999, and then evaluated in terms of AUC in the validating year 2001.
We also made the final dataset publicly available in our Github repository
                                   (https://github.com/JarFraud/FraudDetection/blob/master/data_FraudDetection_JAR2020.csv).
The file "data_FraudDetection_JAR2020.csv" is the final dataset which contains the fraud labels, feature variables, and related variables (e.g., fyear, gvkey, and p_aaer). The variable "misstate" is the fraud label (1 denotes fraud, and 0 denotes non-fraud). The 28 raw accounting data items are: act, ap, at, ceq, che, cogs, csho, dlc, dltis, dltt, dp, ib, invt, ivao, ivst, lct, lt, ni, ppegt, pstk, re, rect, sale, sstk, txp, txt, xint, prcc_f. The 14 financial ratios are: dch_wc, ch_rsst, dch_rec, dch_inv, soft_assets, ch_cs, ch_cm, ch_roa, issue, bm, dpi, reoa, EBIT, ch_fcf. The variable "p_aaer" is used for handling the serial fraud issue.
